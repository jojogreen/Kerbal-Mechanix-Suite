# Orbital-Mechanix-Suite

This project is designed to create a user friendly orbital mechanics platform with high functionality.

The base values for the planets are based on the Horizons web interface by jpl http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons.cgi and testing
has been completed to ensure that outputs fairly to values generated by Horizons interface. Testing on the code has been done and True anomaly is within 1 degree, radius is within 1million km. Additionally, Lambert's solver is within .05 km/s from Earth to Mars based on the code given in "Orbital Mechanics for Engineering Students" third edition by Howard Curtis.

This code uses the J2000 Epoch as a starting point (http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/txt/p_elem_t1.txt). As of right now, the data output does not account for orbit perturbation due to time. This is because for most instances, the effect of these perturbations is insignificant to the overall number. This program is designed to be a quick reference for people interested in Orbital Mechanics and celestial motion.
