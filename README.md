# Orbital-Mechanix-Suite

This project is designed to create a user friendly orbital mechanics platform with high functionality.

The base values for the planets are based on the Horizons web interface by jpl http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons.cgi and testing
has been completed to ensure that outputs are close to values generated by Horizons interface. This code uses the J2000 Epoch as
a starting point. As of right now, the data output does not account for orbit perturbation due to time. This is because for most
instances, the effect of these perturbations is insignificant to the overall number. This program is designed to be a quick 
reference for people interested in Orbital Mechanics and celestial motion.
